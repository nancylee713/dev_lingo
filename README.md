# Dev Lingo
Dev Lingo is a Node API, in which a user can add a new lingo by filling in the form on the frontend; the user can also retrieve a list of all words in JSON by appending `/api/v1/vocab` to the root url of the website (click [here](https://dev-lingo.herokuapp.com/) to see demo). Currently, the app is functional, but the CRUD functionalities have not been fully implemented yet.


### Getting started
1. First `fork` this repo and clone down your version of this repo.
2. Then, run the following command in your terminal to get started.

3. Set up your local database, like `dev_lingo_dev`. In this project, Postgres is used (see `knexfile.js` to modify db configs).  
4. Once you have your database setup, youâ€™ll need to run some migrations for both development and testing environments.

```
knex migrate:latest
knex migrate:latest --env test
```
